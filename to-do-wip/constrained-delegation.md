## Description

Constrained Delegation is where a if we have a computer such as a File Server with the **"INSERT"** option enabled.



Kerberos delegation in Active Directory is the ability for an object such as a user or computer to "re-use end user credentials" to access resources hosted on a different server. &#x20;

Unconstrained Delegation is where if we have a computer such as a File Server with the "Trust this computer for delegation to any service" option enabled and then a Domain Administrator logs into the File Server we can grab a copy of the Domain Administrators TGT and use this to authenticate **anywhere** in the Domain.

To impersonate the userm Service for User (S4U) extension is used which provides to further extensions:

* **Service for User to Self (S4U2self):** Allows a service to obtain a forward-able TGS to itself on behalf of a user.
* **Service for User to proxy (S4U2proxy):** Allows a service to obtain a TGS to a second service on behalf of a user.
