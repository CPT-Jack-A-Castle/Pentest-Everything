# Authentication Bypass

In some instances it may be possible to enumerate users names from a login page. In the example below the username admin is recognised as being an existing username and as such the login page has returned this as an error.

`ffuf` can be used to enumerate further usernames.

```bash
ffuf -w names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.136.193/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
```
