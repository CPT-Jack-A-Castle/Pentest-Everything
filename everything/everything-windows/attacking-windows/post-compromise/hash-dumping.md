# Hash Dumping

We can use the secretsdump.py script in the Impacket toolkit to dump hashes. If we have an account that as in the local administrators group for a machine or a domain administrator we can use secretsdump.py against it to dump hashes.

```
secretsdump.py vuln/bart.simpson:Password001@192.168.64.129
```

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1541).png>)

When using this against multiple machines we can check the hashes for accounts to see if password reuse is in effect.

In the below output we see we have dumped the hashes on two separate machines. We can identify that the local administrator account on both machines is using the same hash which means password reuse is in effect. Information for moving laterally around the network.
