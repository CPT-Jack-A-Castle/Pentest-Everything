### T1134.002: Create Process with Token

**Permissions Required: **<mark style="color:red;">**Administrator**</mark>** | **<mark style="color:green;">**User**</mark>

**Description**

Adversaries may create a new process with a different token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as `CreateProcessWithTokenW` and `runas`.

Creating processes with a different token may require the credentials of the target user, specific privileges to impersonate that user, or access to the token to be used (ex: gathered via other means such as Token Impersonation/Theft or Make and Impersonate Token).
